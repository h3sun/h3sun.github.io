  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Haihao! I was born in Nanjing, China, and moved to San Diego at 18 for a computer science degree, then to New Haven for my master's. My background in computer science focuses on software and machine learning, with interests in **algorithms, recommender system, and machine learning**.

In my spare time, I enjoy programming competitions, board games like Dominion and go(weiqi), and have previously enjoyed Splendor, Wingspan, and Fortnite. I'm also proud to be the first engineer in my family!
