## 🌍 One Country a Day Project

I've decided to embark on an ambitious learning journey: studying one country every day. This project aims to expand my knowledge of world geography, economics, and cultures through systematic daily exploration.

### 📊 Day 1: Data Analysis Foundation

For the first day, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis to identify the top 100 countries based on three key metrics:

- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** - Economic strength and development
- **Population** - Human capital and market size  
- **Surface Area** - Geographic scale and natural resources

This analysis serves as the foundation for my daily country studies, helping me prioritize which countries to explore first and understand the global landscape.

You can find the complete data analysis and methodology in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/h3sun/cursor-country-data-analysis), which includes the World Bank data processing, ranking algorithms, and combined scoring system.

### 📋 Data Reference: Country Combined Scores

The analysis produced a comprehensive dataset (`country_combined_scores_with_region.csv`) that includes:

- **Country Rankings**: Individual rankings for population, GDP, surface area, and GDP per capita
- **Combined Scores**: Overall performance metrics across all dimensions
- **Regional Classification**: Countries grouped by geographic regions (East Asia & Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe & Central Asia, Middle East, North America, South Asia)
- **Time Period**: Data from 2020-2024 with calculated averages

This dataset serves as the foundation for selecting which countries to study first, prioritizing nations with the highest combined scores across all metrics.

### 🌏 Regional Study Strategy

I'm planning to study the top 100 countries systematically, region by region, following this order:

1. **East Asia & Pacific** - Starting with the dynamic economies of Asia
2. **Middle East** - Exploring the strategic crossroads of three continents
3. **Europe & Central Asia** - Understanding the historical and economic powerhouses
4. **Sub-Saharan Africa** - Discovering the continent's emerging markets and diverse cultures
5. **North America** - Analyzing the established economic giants
6. **Latin America & Caribbean** - Exploring the region's natural resources and development

This regional approach will allow me to understand geographic patterns, cultural similarities, and economic relationships within each area before moving to the next region.

### 📐 5 Dimensions Framework

For each country, I'll analyze them across these 5 key dimensions using a 0-5 scoring system:

1. **Natural Resources (0–5)** – Energy/minerals, arable land, freshwater
2. **Climate & Livability (0–5)** – Long-term climate + disaster risk
3. **Geo Composite (0–5)** – 60% Geo_Defense (terrain, coast/landlocked, chokepoints, neighbor exposure) + 40% Geopolitics (alliances, sanctions/alignment risk, regional integration, external threats, strategic leverage)
4. **Governance & Rule of Law (0–5)** – Political rights, civil liberties, corruption
5. **Economy & Development (0–5)** – Income level, diversification, medium-term growth

### 🎯 Project Goals

- **Daily Learning**: Dedicate time each day to study one country
- **Comprehensive Understanding**: Cover geography, history, culture, economy, and current affairs
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Use statistics and facts to guide learning priorities
- **Global Perspective**: Develop a broader worldview through systematic exploration

### 📈 Next Steps

With the top 100 countries identified, I'll begin my daily deep-dive into each nation, starting with the most significant countries by the combined metrics. Each day will bring new insights and expand my understanding of our diverse world.

Stay tuned for daily country profiles and insights from this learning journey!
