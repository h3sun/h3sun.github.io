| **1) Natural Resources**                                    | **Arable land:** \~**13.5%** of land area (WB series). ([Trading Economics][1]) ‚Ä¢ **Freshwater:** \~**1,257 m¬≥/person/yr** (latest WB/FAO series). ([Index Mundi][2]) ‚Ä¢ **Energy endowment:** imports **\~96%** of energy; resource self-sufficiency \~**13.3%** (incl. overseas projects). Heavy crude dependence on the **Middle East** (‚âà**71.5%** of crude in 2024). ([IEEFA][3], [MK News][4]) |     **2.2** | Limited hydrocarbons and modest arable/water per capita; strong refining/industrial base doesn't offset basic resource scarcity.      |
| **2) Climate & Livability**                                 | **ND-GAIN (2023):** rank **15**, score **67.4** (low vulnerability, high readiness). ([ND-GAIN Index][5]) ‚Ä¢ **WorldRiskIndex 2023:** **WRI 10.84**, **rank 49/193** (moderate disaster risk‚Äîquakes, floods, typhoons).                                                                                                                                                                              |     **3.1** | High adaptive capacity and governance lift livability, but multi-hazard exposure keeps risk non-trivial.                              |
| **3) Geo Composite** *(60% Geo\_Defense + 40% Geopolitics)* | **Geo-defense:** peninsula with one hostile land border (DPRK); sea-lines of communication for energy via **Hormuz ‚Üí Malacca/Singapore** chokepoints. ([EIA][6]) ‚Ä¢ **Geopolitics:** binding **U.S.‚ÄìROK Mutual Defense Treaty**; deepening **U.S.‚ÄìJapan‚ÄìROK** trilateral cooperation; **RCEP** in force for Korea since **Feb 1, 2022**. ([USFK][7], [The White House][8], [ASEAN Main Portal][9])   |     **3.8** | Strong alliance architecture and advanced forces; vulnerabilities are SLOC/chokepoint exposure and proximate DPRK threat.             |
| **4) Governance & Rule of Law**                             | **Freedom House 2024:** **83/100 (Free)**. ([Freedom House][10]) ‚Ä¢ **WJP Rule of Law 2024:** **rank 19/142**. ([World Justice Project][11]) ‚Ä¢ **TI CPI 2024:** **64/100**, **rank 30/180**.

| **5) Economy & Development**                                | **GDP per capita (current US\$ 2023):** **\$33,121** (high income by WB threshold). ([World Bank Data][13]) ‚Ä¢ **Growth outlook:** **\~0.8% (IMF 2025)**; **\~1.0% (OECD 2025)** with a pickup signaled for 2026. ([IMF][14], [OECD][15])                                                                                                                                                            |     **3.5** | Advanced, diversified manufacturing-services economy; near-term growth soft (external demand, demographics), medium-term still solid.        |

### üéØ Overall Assessment

**Combined Score: 16.9/25 (67.6%)**

South Korea represents a remarkable case study in overcoming natural resource limitations through human capital, innovation, and strong governance. Despite scarce natural resources, it has built one of the world's most advanced economies through technological leadership and strategic international partnerships.

### üîç Key Insights

1. **Resource Innovation**: Limited natural resources have driven innovation in technology and efficiency, creating competitive advantages
2. **Strategic Alliances**: Strong U.S. partnership and international integration provide security and economic benefits
3. **Human Capital Focus**: Investment in education and technology has created a highly skilled workforce that drives economic success
