| **1) Natural Resources**                                   | **Arable land \~2.0%** (plantation/pasture-heavy); **forest cover \~37.7%**; **renewable internal freshwater \~63,976 m¬≥/person (2021)**. Power mix is resource-rich: **88% renewable electricity in 2023** (hydro, geothermal, wind). **Geothermal capacity \~1.2 GW** (Tauhara II added in 2024). **Gas reserves are declining**. ([TheGlobalEconomy.com][1], [World Bank Open Data][2], [DataBank][3], [MBIE][4], [ThinkGeoEnergy][5])                                                                                                                      |     **3.6** | Abundant water + renewables and usable forests offset limited arable land and modest minerals; gas depletion is a mild drag.                          |
| **2) Climate & Livability**                                | Temperate maritime climate with strong **adaptation readiness** (**ND-GAIN rank 7, high readiness**), but exposed to **earthquakes** (e.g., **2016 Kaik≈çura** NZ$2‚Äì3 bn losses) and **severe storms** (e.g., **Cyclone Gabrielle 2023**, \~NZ$9‚Äì14.5 bn damage). ([ND-GAIN Index][6], [U.S. Geological Survey][7], [Wikipedia][8])                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     **3.3** | Very livable baseline climate and strong institutions, tempered by seismic and extreme-weather risk that is material and rising.                      |
| **3) Geo Composite** *(60% Geo-Defense + 40% Geopolitics)* | **Geo-Defense:** Remote **island state** with **\~15,000 km coastline** and a **\~4.0‚Äì4.3 million km¬≤ EEZ**‚Äîno land borders (low invasion exposure), but limited chokepoint leverage. ([Te Ara][9], [Ministry for the Environment][10]) **Geopolitics:** Deep ties via **Five Eyes** and **FPDA**; U.S.‚ÄìNZ ties normalized via the **Wellington (2010)/Washington (2012) Declarations**; broad trade integration (**CPTPP in force since Dec 30, 2018; RCEP since Jan 1, 2022**). ([NZ Security Intelligence][11], [NZDF][12], [Congress.gov][13], [MFAT][14]) |     **4.0** | Strong alliance network and strategic depth from remoteness/EEZ; minimal neighbor exposure; fewer coercive levers than chokepoint states.             |
| **4) Governance & Rule of Law**                            | **Freedom House 2025: 99/100 (Free)**; **TI CPI 2024: 83/100, rank 4/180**; **EIU Democracy Index 2024: 9.61** (full democracy).

| **5) Economy & Development**                               | **High-income:** **GDP per capita (current US$) \~$48.7k (2024)**; **IMF 2025 growth \~1.4%** (modest). Exports are diversified but primary-heavy (**dairy/meat/wood** lead goods; **tourism/services ‚âà30% of total exports in 2024**). ([World Bank Open Data][2], [IMF][18], [Stats NZ][19], [MFAT][20])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     **3.6** | Strong income/HDI and credible policy; small scale and primary concentration keep medium-term growth in the mid-1‚Äì2% range absent productivity gains. |

### üéØ Overall Assessment

New Zealand combines strong governance, rule of law, and human capital with an open, export-oriented economy centered on services, high-value agriculture, tourism, and niche manufacturing. Its geographic isolation provides biosecurity and defense depth but implies long logistics chains and small domestic market scale. Climate exposure (e.g., to extreme weather) and reliance on external demand are balanced by robust institutions, diversified trade relationships, and a credible macro policy framework.

### üîç Key Insights

1. **Institutional Strength**: Consistently ranks high on governance, transparency, and ease of doing business.
2. **Economic Structure**: Services-led economy with strong agrifood, tourism, tech-enabled services, and renewable power base.
3. **Trade Integration**: Deep Asia-Pacific integration (e.g., CPTPP, RCEP) and strong ties with Australia and China; Five Eyes security network with U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia.
4. **Human Capital**: High education outcomes and immigration-friendly policy support skills and innovation.
