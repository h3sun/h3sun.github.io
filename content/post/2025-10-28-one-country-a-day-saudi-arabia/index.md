## üá∏üá¶ Saudi Arabia - Day 36/100 of One Country a Day Project

Saudi Arabia stands as the economic and spiritual heart of the Islamic world, wielding massive influence through its vast oil reserves, strategic location, and religious significance. As the world's largest oil exporter and a founding member of OPEC, Saudi Arabia has leveraged its hydrocarbon wealth to transform from a desert kingdom to a global economic power. However, under Vision 2030, the kingdom is undergoing an ambitious diversification away from oil dependency, investing trillions in megaprojects, technology, tourism, and renewable energy. From its custodianship of Islam's two holiest cities to its pivotal role in global energy markets and ambitious NEOM smart city project, Saudi Arabia's story is one of resource abundance, modernization challenges, and strategic positioning. Today, we examine this Middle Eastern heavyweight that balances religious leadership with economic transformation.

| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Natural Resources**        | ~**2nd**-largest proven crude reserves globally (OPEC), very low lift costs; associated gas and growing non-associated gas fields; sizable **phosphate, bauxite, gold** deposits (Ma'aden); **severe freshwater scarcity** mitigated by the world's largest **desalination** system (SWA/SWCC). ([OPEC][1])                   |     **4.8**     | Hydrocarbon endowment and extractive cost advantage are world-class; water scarcity is structural but technologically offset (at high capex/energy cost). |
| **2. Climate & Livability**     | **Arid desert** climate; extreme heat and dust storms; **water stress** structurally high; disaster risk (earthquakes, cyclones) relatively low; major cities have high-quality urban services powered by desalination and AC. ([TIME][2])                                                                                    |     **2.6**     | Environmental comfort is limited outside modern urban cores; livability relies on energy-intensive water and cooling infrastructure.                      |
| **3. Geo Composite**            | **Geo-Defense (60%)**: Large territory, interior desert buffers, **long Red Sea & Gulf coasts**, but exposed land borders incl. **Yemen**; high air/missile defense demand. **Geopolitics (40%)**: **G20**, OPEC+ swing producer; close U.S./GCC ties while expanding ties with Asia; energy leverage notable. ([Reuters][3]) |     **3.8**     | Geography offers depth and sea access but also border exposure; geopolitical centrality via energy gives outsized influence.                              |
| **4. Governance & Rule of Law** | **Freedom House 2024:** **8/100** ("Not Free"). **Transparency Int'l CPI 2024:** **59/100** (rank **38/180**). **Rule-of-Law** indicators low by WJP/WB standards. ([Freedom House][4])                                                                                                                                       |     **1.6**     | Authoritarian governance and rights constraints weigh on institutional quality, despite anticorruption and administrative reforms.                        |
| **5. Economy & Development**    | **High-income** status; 2024 **real GDP +1.3%** with **non-oil +4.3%** and oil down on OPEC+ cuts; strong fiscal buffers, low debt; active **Vision 2030** diversification (tourism, logistics, mining, sports, renewables). ([Reuters][3])                                                                                   |     **3.6**     | Non-oil momentum is real but base remains hydrocarbon-centric; execution and global oil cycles remain key sensitivities.                                  |

### üìä Summary Analysis

| **Summary**                  | **Interpretation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strengths**                | World-class **oil & gas** reserves with very low costs; **energy swing producer** status; large domestic market with improving non-oil growth; **strategic coasts and location**; massive **desalination** capacity supporting urban resilience. ([OPEC][1])                                  |
| **Weaknesses**               | **Climate stress** and water scarcity; **institutional constraints** (rights, rule-of-law); exposure to **oil price/production cycles**; border security risks (esp. Yemen). ([Freedom House][2])                                                                                             |
| **Trajectory (2020s‚Äì2030s)** | Continued push to **diversify** (mining, tourism, entertainment, logistics, green energy) while maintaining oil leadership; success hinges on **execution capacity**, fiscal discipline through cycles, and gradual regulatory/institutional upgrades to crowd-in private/FDI.
