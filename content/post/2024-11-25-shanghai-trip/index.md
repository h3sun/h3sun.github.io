# Day1 - 到达 Arrival

我于周六晚上抵达上海浦东国际机场（PVG），并在上海唐镇智选假日酒店度过了在上海的第一个晚上。

电信（中国一家受欢迎的手机提供商）出于保护我的隐私的目的，以某种方式暂停了手机套餐，因为距离我上次在中国使用手机已经快两年了。由于我无法访问互联网，因此无法使用 Uber、Lyft 或任何其他乘车共享应用程序，因此我必须在机场使用现金和传统出租车服务才能到达酒店。

在出租车上，司机故意和我闲聊，绕道走，以便能从我这样的游客身上赚到更多的钱，这让我有一种被骗的感觉。根据该应用程序，预计出租车费约为 80 元，但最终行程为 140 元。当我告诉她我记录了她的服务号码以便将来客户投诉时，她同意给我折扣并向我索要 100 元。我付了她 100 元，带着不愉快的心情下了出租车。

由于长途飞行和不好的出租车服务体验，我感到非常疲惫。此外，由于电话套餐暂停而无法上网，这让我陷入了尴尬的境地，我无法订购 Uber Eats，也无法付款，因为无法使用支付宝或微信支付。

又饿又累，我最后打电话给我高中和大学的朋友天成点餐。同时，我也让父母给电信打电话，恢复我的手机套餐，这样我就可以上网了。

感谢我的朋友和我的父母，吃了老乡鸡的食物和恢复电话套餐后，我感觉自己获得了重生。那天晚上我睡得很好，只是因为时差而早醒。

I arrived at Shanghai Pudong International Airport(PVG) on Saturday evening, and I spent my first night in Shanghai at Holiday Inn Express Shanghai Tangzhen.

Dianxin(a popular phone provider in China) somehow suspended the phone plans for protecting my privacy due to the fact that it's been almost two years since the last time that I used my phone in China. As I do not have access to the Internet, I cannot use Uber, Lyft or any other ride sharing apps, therefore I have to use cash and conventional taxi service at the airport to arrive my hotel.

During the taxi ride, the driver deliberately made small talks with me and took detours such that she could possibly earn more money from a visitor like me, which makes me feel scamed. While the estimated taxi fees, according to the app, is around 80rmb, the trip ended up being 140 rmb. As I told her that I recorded her service number for future customer complains, she agreed to give me a discount and asked 100 rmb from me. I paied her 100rmb and left the taxi with unfavorable feelings.

I feel extremely tired due to the long flight and unfavorable experience of taxi service. Additionally, not having access to Internet due to the suspended phone plan put me into an akward situation where I cannot order uber eats and cannot pay money becuase of not being able to use AliPay or Wechat Pay.

Starving and Tired, I ended up calling my high school and college friend Tiancheng for ordering food. Meanwhile, I also asked my parents to call Dianxin for resuming my phone plan such that I can have access to Internet and everything.

Thanks to my friend and my parents, I felt that I got reborn after the food from Hometown Chicken and resuming my phone plan. I had a farily good sleep that night, except waked up early due to jet lag.

# Day2 - 与高中和大学朋友重聚 Reunion with high school and college friend

8:00 左右起床，与潜在的新经理会面了大约 20 分钟，讨论了一些内部调动的潜在计划；我对嵌入技术感到非常兴奋，唯一剩下的就是与我的经理讨论转组事宜。

天成于 10：00 到达酒店，我们一起在智选假日酒店吃早餐。早餐后，我参观了他的公寓，并在附近的理发店理发。午餐吃完韩国菜后，我们去上海滨江森林公园散步。公园很大，种满了植物，还有野餐的地方。我们逛了一会儿，在一池咖啡店喝了杯咖啡或茶。

晚上我们从浦东去了静安，周二我要去那里面试签证。我们在一家港式咖啡厅吃饭，菜的味道非常好，湾区没有一家餐厅能与之媲美。饭后，我们在上海静安散步。我们之前一起去过上海两次，一次是 2020 年夏天，庆祝学期季度结束，另一次是 2021 年夏天，在我们离开中国去美国读研究生之前。上海和我们上次去的时候一样，甚至繁华，只是我觉得自己老了，消化食物的能力变差了，精力也变少了。这种感觉让我陷入了一种情绪状态。

城市漫步结束后，我们回到城市酒店，我和他告别，他开车回去了，因为周一是他的工作日。那天晚上 9 点左右我感到非常困，晚上 9 点半左右就睡着了，大概睡觉是我情绪低落时能做的最好的事情吧。

Waked up at around 8:00, I met with my potential new manager for around 20 minutes, discussing some potential plans for internal transfer; I am super excited about the embedding technology, the only thing remaining is to talk with my manager about the transfer.

Tiancheng arrived at the hotel at 10:00, we had breakfast together at Holiday Inn Express. After the breakfast, I visited his apartment and got a haircut at a barber nearby. After the korean food for lunch, we went to Shanghai Binjiang Forest Park for a walk. The park was quite big, full with plants and picnickers. We walked around for a while, had a cup of coffee or tea at the Yichi Coffee.

At night we went from Pudong district to Jing'an district where I would do visa interview on Tuesday. We had dinner at a Hong Kong-style cafe, the dishes taste so good that there is no restaurants comparable to this one in the bay area. After the dinner, we did some city walk in Jing'an, Shanghai. We've been to Shanghai together twice before, once in 2020 summer, celebrating the quarter ending, another time in 2021 summer, before we left China to America for starting grad school. Shanghai is the same or even more bustling than last time we went there, it's just I feel I am getting older, with less ability to digest food and less energy. This kinda of feelings put me into an emotional state.

After the citywalk, we went back to City Hotel, I said farewell to him, and he drove back as Monday is a work day for him. I felt extremely sleepy around 9:00 and felt in asleep around 9:30PM that night, probably feeeling asleep is the best thing I can do when feeling emotional.
