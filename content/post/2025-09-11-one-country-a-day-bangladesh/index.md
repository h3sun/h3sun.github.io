### üåç 5-Dimension Analysis

| Dimension                                                | Key data points (latest where available)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Score (0‚Äì5) | Why this score                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1) Natural Resources**                                 | Arable land **60.5%** of land area (2022); agricultural land **72.35%** (2022). Forest cover **‚âà14.5%** (2022). Renewable internal freshwater availability is **low (\~600‚Äì800 m¬≥/person/yr)**, i.e., at/under water-stress thresholds. Energy endowment: legacy **onshore gas** is depleting; remaining reserves and output are falling; rising reliance on **LNG** and **coal** in the power mix. ([Trading Economics][1])                 |     **2.7** | Exceptional arable endowment but modest minerals/energy and tight freshwater per capita pull the score down.                                            |
| **2) Climate & Livability**                              | Among the **most climate-vulnerable** globally: WorldRiskIndex **#9/193 (2023)**; ND-GAIN **rank 178/192, score 32.9** (very low readiness). High exposure to **cyclones, floods, storm surge**; 2024 floods destroyed \~**1.1 Mt** of rice. ([Climate Centre][2])                                                                                                                                                                           |     **1.6** | Hazard exposure + sea-level and riverine flood risks are severe despite notable disaster-management gains.                                              |
| **3) Geo Composite** (60% Geo-Defense + 40% Geopolitics) | **Geo-Defense:** Flat deltaic terrain; borders: **India \~4,096.7 km**, **Myanmar 271 km**; **coastline \~580 km** on Bay of Bengal‚Äîno control of a choke-point; defense depth limited. **Geopolitics:** Non-aligned balancing with India/China; active in **UN peacekeeping (top contributor)**; regional blocs **SAARC, BIMSTEC, IORA**; major partners (WB/IMF) financing port/infra (e.g., Bay Terminal at Chattogram). ([Wikipedia][3]) |     **2.5** | Geography is defensively challenging; geopolitical ties and peacekeeping stature add leverage but don't offset terrain/exposure.                        |
| **4) Governance & Rule of Law**                          | **Freedom House 2025:** Global Freedom **45/100 (Partly Free)**; 2024‚Äì25 saw political upheaval and interim gov't. **TI CPI 2024:** **23/100**, **rank 151/180** (lowest in 13 years). ([Freedom House][4])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     **1.9** | Partial political freedoms; corruption perceptions are poor even after the 2024 transition‚Äîkeeping the score low.                                       |
| **5) Economy & Development**                             | **Income level:** **Lower-middle income** (World Bank). **Growth outlook:** FY2024/25 **\~3.3‚Äì4.1%** (WB/ADB) and **\~3.8%** (IMF) amid uncertainty; FY2025/26 seen improving. **Export structure:** **Apparel/RMG ‚âà84.6%** of exports (FY2024); FY2024/25 RMG ‚âà **\$39.35 bn** of **\$48.3 bn** exports. **Remittances:** **\~\$30 bn** in FY2024/25 (record). ([World Bank Open Data][5])                                                  |     **2.7** | Strong long-run development record, but near-term growth cooled and exports remain highly concentrated in garments; remittances are a major stabilizer. |

### üéØ Overall Assessment

Bangladesh represents a remarkable development success story despite extreme climate vulnerability and governance challenges. Its future depends on economic diversification, climate adaptation, and institutional strengthening while managing demographic transition and regional dynamics.

### üîç Key Insights

1. **Climate Paradox**: Despite being the world's most climate-vulnerable country, Bangladesh has achieved strong economic growth and poverty reduction.
2. **Garment Success**: Textile industry transformation has been the engine of growth, but diversification is critical for sustainability.
3. **Demographic Transition**: Population growth slowing, urbanization accelerating, requiring massive job creation and infrastructure investment.
4. **Regional Dynamics**: Strategic location between India and China offers opportunities but also creates dependency and complexity.
