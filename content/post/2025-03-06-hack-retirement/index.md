## 401(k), IRA, pre-tax, after-tax 扫盲

### 📌 按照账户类型：401(k) vs. IRA

1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Plan)**

   - 公司提供的，公司有的时候会提供 match。
   - 投资选择比较少。
   - 有管理费。
   - RMD （Required Minimum Distribution）72 岁以后要取钱。
   - 59.5 岁取钱才不会有罚金。
   - Possible administration fees from the employer.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - 个人开户，不需要公司提供。
   - 投资选择多样。
   - **Roth IRA 没有 RMDs**, but **Traditional IRA 有**.
   - 没有管理费。

### 🔹 按照投入方式：税前 VS 税后

1. **Pre-Tax**

   - 税前投入，可以降低 tax bracket。
   - 取出的时候交税。

2. **After-Tax**
   - 税后投入，不能降低 tax bracket。
   - 没有资本利得税。
   - 取出的时候不用交税。

## 税收总结

| When do you pay tax       | Contribution | Growth | Withdrawal (Subject to income tax) |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Traditional (Pre-Tax)** | No           | No     | Yes                                |
| **Roth (After-Tax)**      | Yes          | No     | No                                 |
| **After-Tax Backdoors**   | Yes          | No     | Yes                                |

## 🚀 如何把钱放进去（假设你是一个公司雇员）

### 📌 公司相关

1. Employee contribution (22500)
2. Employer matching
3. mega backdoor

1 + 2 + 3 <= 66000

### 📌 个人行为

- step1， 开一个 traditional IRA，roth IRA
- step2，个人银行 6500 转到 traditional IRA
- step3，settle 以后立刻转 Roth IRA
- step4，File 8606

## 💡 如何选择

1. pre-tax or after-tax？取决于你将来的收入会不会比现在高？
2. 401(k) or IRA？你的投资水平能不能赢跑赢大盘？
3. rollover，基本来说 pre-tax 能换 after-tax，401k 能换 IRA

## 🔥 **Mega Backdoor Roth Strategy**

💡 The **Mega Backdoor Roth** is an advanced retirement savings strategy that allows high earners to **move after-tax 401(k) contributions into a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)**, unlocking tax-free growth.

### ✅ **How It Works:**

1. **Max out regular 401(k) contributions** ($23,000 in 2024, $30,500 if 50+).
2. **Make additional after-tax contributions** (if your plan allows).
3. **Immediately convert after-tax contributions into a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)** (before earnings accumulate and become taxable).
4. **Enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement!**

### 🔷 **Why Use the Mega Backdoor Roth?**

- Allows **higher Roth contributions beyond standard limits**.
- Helps **high earners** build tax-free retirement income.
- **Avoids RMDs** if rolled into a Roth IRA.

⚠️ **Not all employer 401(k) plans allow after-tax contributions or in-plan Roth conversions.** Check your plan’s rules!

## 🚀 Retirement Tax Hack: Choosing the Right Plan

- If you're in a **high tax bracket now**, a **Traditional 401(k) or IRA** can reduce taxable income.
- If you expect to be in a **higher tax bracket later**, a **Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA** helps avoid future taxes.
- **Max out employer 401(k) matching first** before investing in IRAs.
- **Diversify**: Having both **pre-tax and after-tax** accounts gives flexibility in retirement withdrawals.

## 📢 Final Thoughts
