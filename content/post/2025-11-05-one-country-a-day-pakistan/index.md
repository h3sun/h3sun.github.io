## 🇵🇰 Pakistan - Day 40/100 of One Country a Day Project

Pakistan stands as South Asia's second-most populous nation — a country of dramatic mountain ranges and fertile river valleys, strategic geographic position and persistent economic challenges, nuclear capability and developmental aspirations. As the world's fifth-most populous country and a key player in regional geopolitics, Pakistan bridges Central Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East, positioned at the crossroads of major trade routes and energy corridors. Yet decades of political instability, security concerns, fiscal pressures, and natural disasters have shaped a complex development trajectory. From the 1947 partition that created the modern state to the 1971 Bangladesh War, from its role as a Cold War ally to becoming a nuclear power in 1998, from strategic partnerships with both the United States and China to ongoing tensions with India over Kashmir, Pakistan's story is one of resilience: a young nation with immense human capital and strategic location navigating between military influence, democratic transitions, and economic transformation. Today, we examine this South Asian nation that connects the Himalayas to the Arabian Sea, balancing between regional power dynamics and domestic development priorities.

| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Natural Resources**        | Indus Basin irrigates much of the cropland; major lignite resource at **Thar** (~175 bn tons); large undeveloped **Reko Diq** copper-gold project advancing; sizable hydropower potential (e.g., Dasu). ([World Bank][1])                                                                                            |     **3.2**     | Considerable minerals/energy endowment and irrigation network, but domestic oil & gas are declining and coal is low-grade; water stress and governance limit extraction benefits.       |
| **2. Climate & Livability**     | High exposure to floods/heatwaves (e.g., 2022 floods); **ND-GAIN** rank ≈ **152** with low readiness; repeated extreme heat in 2024 noted by AP/UN; sea-level risk on Indus delta. ([ND-GAIN Index][2])                                                                                                              |     **2.0**     | Climate vulnerability and urban livability challenges (heat, flooding, water stress) weigh on health and productivity despite improving infrastructure in select corridors.             |
| **3. Geo Composite**            | **Geo-Defense (60%)**: Mountain buffers (Hindu Kush/Karakoram), but long, open plains front with India; **1,046 km** Arabian Sea coast incl. Karachi/Gwadar. **Geopolitics (40%)**: Nuclear-armed; **Major non-NATO ally (US)** since 2004; deep **China** ties via CPEC; recurrent security risks. ([Wikipedia][3]) |     **3.6**     | Strategic location bridging South/Central Asia and the Gulf with credible deterrence and multiple patrons; however, border frictions and internal security concerns constrain leverage. |
| **4. Governance & Rule of Law** | **Freedom House 2024:** **32/100 (Partly Free)**; **Transparency Intl CPI 2024:** **27/100 (rank 135/180)**; **WJP Rule of Law 2024:** **rank 129/142**. ([Freedom House][4])                                                                                                                                        |     **1.8**     | Persistent constraints on civil liberties, corruption risks, and weak judicial/administrative performance dampen investment climate and policy credibility.                             |
| **5. Economy & Development**    | Nominal GDP ≈ **$373 bn** (2024); GDP pc (nominal) ≈ **$1.6k**; PPP pc ≈ **$6.7k**; FY25 growth ~**2–3%**; IMF program support; export base concentrated in textiles; external financing pressures flagged by rating agencies. ([World Bank Open Data][5])                                                           |     **2.6**     | Large, young market with stabilization under IMF and improving energy mix, yet low productivity, narrow export basket, and dollar/liquidity constraints cap near-term momentum.         |

| **Strengths**                | Strategic location with **Arabian Sea access** and overland links to China/Central Asia; **nuclear deterrent** and multiple external partners; large domestic market; substantial **coal (Thar)** and **copper-gold (Reko Diq)** potential; hydropower pipeline. ([Pak Consulate LA][1]) |
| **Weaknesses**               | High **climate vulnerability** (floods/heat/sea-level) and **water stress**; governance/corruption concerns; external-financing dependence; export concentration (textiles); periodic security disruptions. ([ND-GAIN Index][2])                                                         |
| **Trajectory (2020s–2030s)** | Base case: gradual stabilization under IMF with **modest growth** and incremental reforms; upside from **CPEC/REKO Diq/hydropower** if execution and security improve; downside from climate shocks, commodity swings, and reform slippage.
