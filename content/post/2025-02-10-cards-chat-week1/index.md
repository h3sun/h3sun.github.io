## Day 1 - The power of position (Fundamental)

### Key Takeaways

1. Understand the Understand the different positions, including what each one is called and the order that they act in both pre-flop and post-flop: SB, BB, UTG, UTG+1, LJ, HJ, CO, BTN.

2. You can play many more hands profitably on the button or in late position than from the early positions.

3. Bonus Concept: You can have good “relative position” if you’re to the right of a very aggressive player in a multiway pot.

## Day 2 - The benefits of Aggression (Fundamental)

### Key Takeaways

1. Three fundamental types of actions you can take

   - call -> passive
   - check/fold -> neutral
   - bet/raise -> aggressive

2. Think about the players that you enjoy having as opponents. Who would you rather play against: A passive opponent who’s mainly checking and calling or an aggressive opponent who’s betting and raising a lot?

## Day 3 - Thinking in Ranges (Fundamental)

### Key Takeaways

1. Understand what a range is and how they’re written.

2. During a hand of poker, we have one hand that stays the same, while our opponents have ranges that are changing with each new action they take.

3. Thinking in ranges is still an extremely valuable framework, even if the ranges are imprecise or we put Villain on a very wide range.

## Day 4 - The Two Types of Equity (Fundamental)

### Key Takeaways

1. Understand the concept of your equity in a pot as a poker hand progresses.

2. Your equity against an opponent’s range is simply how often you win the hand (assuming nobody folds) if he’s equally likely to hold any hand in his range.

3. After every hand in a tournament, your equity changes to reflect how much money you’ll win on average playing out the tournament from that point forward.

## Day 5 Understanding Pot Odds and Expected Value (Fundamental)

### Key Takeaways

1. Understand what pot odds are and how to calculate them.

2. Pot odds tell you what percent of the time you need to win the pot for a call to be profitable. Good players always decide whether to call based on their odds.

3. Expected value is the amount of money you’ll make or lose on average from a given action.

Now that we’ve given these approximate guidelines for opening ranges based on position, it is
time for a bunch of notes and caveats

1. You should tend to play more hands against tight opponents, and fewer hands against loose/wild opponents.
2. When the effective stack is 15bb or less, you will be playing shove/fold pre-flop.
3. When the effective stack is short, such as 15-30bb, your default play is to minraise first in. At moderate effective stacks of around 30-50bb, tend to raise 2.5bb, for example $250 at $50-$100. At deep effective stacks greater than 50bb, tend to raise 3bb such as $300 at $50-$100.
4. Exception to the last rule: From the small blind, you should usually limp first in (or raise to at least 2.5bb against tighter players). Don’t limp first in from any other position.

### Facing Limpers

Fold the weakest hands in your range. Limp behind with some of the weaker hands that still have good playability, such as 22 or 65s . Continue to raise any of the stronger hands you would have played, adding one big blind to your raise sizing for each limper already in the pot.

### Facing Raising

So for now, select situations that you’re confident will be profitable. It’s generally a bigger mistake to continue in a bad spot than it is to make a tight fold and stay out of trouble!

### Key Takeaways

1. Understand approximately what ranges to play from each position when you’re first to voluntarily enter the pot.
2. There are many factors affecting the pre-flop decision-making process including positions, opponent types, effective stack, raise sizings, and tournament state. We’ve done our best to give you good general guidelines. If you’re unsure whether to play a certain hand, then just fold for now and wait for a good spot.
3. The effective stack is the most you can lose in a given hand, which will be the same as your stack size unless you cover everyone else left to act.

## Day 7 Value Bet

### Key Takeaways

1. Understand what it means to make a value bet and how important they are to winning at poker.
2. If you think it’s likely you have the best hand, always consider value betting it.
3. Think about which worse hands your opponent can call your value bet with.
