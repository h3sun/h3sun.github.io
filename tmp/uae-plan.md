# Overview of the Final State of the Feature
- A new United Arab Emirates installment dated 2025-11-11 is added, matching the existing structure with key facts, 5-dimension analysis, and summary tables.

# List of Files to Change
- `content/post/2025-11-11-one-country-a-day-united-arab-emirates/index.md`: create new Markdown post with full UAE analysis mirroring the Algeria template but with UAE-specific content, citations, and updated scoring.
